        <h1>About TheDiscDb</h1>
        <p>
            We help movie collectors turn shelves of discs into organized digital libraries by sharing
            accurate playlist mappings and metadata captured by the community.

            <p>
                For anyone building a digital movie collection, <a href="https://makemkv.com" target="_blank"
                rel="noreferrer" title="Makemkv official site">MakeMKV</a> is indispensable. TheDiscDb extends
                that workflow by letting collectors share disc layouts so you always know which playlists
                contain movies, episodes, or extras.

            <h2>How it helps</h2>
            <p>
                Instead of guessing which title is the real movie or which playlist holds the finale of a season,
                you can see what other contributors discovered, verify logs, and rip once with confidence.

            MakeMKV logs, and map playlists. When you share the layout of your discs with the community - everyone benefits.
