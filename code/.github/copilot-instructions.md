# Copilot Instructions

## Project Guidelines
- Never commit directly to the `main` branch. Always use a feature branch for changes.

## Code Style
- Razor files should be formatted with markup in the .razor file and code in a separate .razor.cs code-behind file. Do not use @code blocks in .razor files.
